      Discretized Fast Fourier Transform of Sine Wave Using SciLAB
    </h3>
    
    <h4>
      Discussion:
      <hr />
    </h4>
    <p>
      The plan here is to use the Fortran 2003 program that utilizes the FFTW3 library to generate a<br>
      Discretized Fast Fourier Transforms of a 10Hz sine wave, sampled at 1000Hz.  SciLAB is used to <br>
      generate the the time domain function, time domain and frequency domain plots and discretized<br> 
      time domain data.  The Fortran 2003 code is then run on the discretized time domain data and the<br>
      results plotted with GNUPlot.  A comparison is made to check the veracity of the Fortran 2003 code<br> 
      output.<br>
      <hr /><br>
    </p>
    
    <p> <b> Introduction: </b><br>
      First, we start with SciLAB to generate a 10Hz sine wave, sampled at 1000Hz, and save these data points<br>
      into a CSV file.  We also perform a DFFT in SciLAB so that we may compare the results to the output<br>
      of our Fortran 2003 code that uses the FFTW3 algorithm.  The SciLAB code is shown below:<br>

    <p> <b> Saving of time-domain data into a comma-separated value (CSV) file </b> <br>

    </p>
    
    <p> <b> Processing of CSV file into format suitable for input into Fortran 2003 DFFT code. </b> <br>
      Since the output of SciLAB is a comma separated value (CSV) file, a method is needed that will process<br>
      that file into another file, where the commas are removed and each data element is on a separate line.<br>
      Additionally, a the data elements need to be reformatted into fixed floating point, since the "e" <br>
      floating point format was noticed to possibly cause errors when input into the FFTW3 algorithm. <br>
      These operations were done using a Python script, with its powerful object-oriented file techniques and<br>
      its included CSV library.  The Python script is shown below: <br>

      The phase plot above displays overall quantization noise and computation noise of FFTW3, since <br>
      pure frequency sine wave with zero phase should have been a straight line at 0 degrees. <br>  
      This plot gives a feel for the accuracy of the computational engine. <br>

    <h4>
      Discussion:
      <hr />
    </h4>
    <p>
      There appears to be good correlation between the DFFT magnitude plot generated by SciLAB and <br>
      the DFFT magnitude plot generated by the Fortran 2003 code.  Of note are is the anomalous<br>
      phase results in the output of the Fortran 2003 code.  It is unknown at this time what is causing it. <br>
      It would be interesting to see the results on a signal with known phase shift. <br>
