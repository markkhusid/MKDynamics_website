            <p> <b> Downloaded *Working* Debian Linux for the CubieTruck </b> <br>
                After many, many, many, many, repeated attempts, and literally days of going through the same process over and over, I have finally found a way to <br>
                to get the CubieTruck up and running on a solid and USEFUL Linux Distribution.  In my travels through the interwebs, I came across this fellow's website:<br>
                <a href="http://www.igorpecovnik.com/2013/12/24/cubietruck-debian-wheezy-sd-card-image" target="_top">Igor Pecovnik - Cubieboard / Cubietruck Debian SD image</a><br>
                I downloaded and used dd to copy the image to a micro-SD card.  This I know how to do very well, since I have done it literally hundreds of times to get this 
                little computer working.  Popped in the SD card into the CubieTruck, and viola!  It booted right up, as easy as a Raspberry Pi!!!<br>
                One thing I could say, is that the CubieTruck is fast, really fast.  The image makes life really easy too.  There is a simple script to move the root <br>
                file system to the NAND chip, making the computer even faster.  The image is very lightweight, and it was a simple matter to install LXDE, my favorite <br>
                lightweight window manager.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I have installed wireshark onto the CubieTruck, to use it as my network monitor.  This small computer runs it very fast, with minimal memory usage.  Very impressive. <br>
                My next project will be install a https webserver on the CubieTruck and use it as the webserver for this website.

            <p> <b> Installed Apache 2 web server onto Cubietruck </b> <br>
                The Cubietruck features a SATA interface for connecting hard drives.  
                This lends it well to a small webserver, since hard drives can go 
                through many read/write cycles, as opposed to SD flash cards.  Also, as 
                an additional security measure, it makes sense to isolate the webserver 
                from other computing assets.
                
                The Cubietruck is currently the webserver for this website.  A typical 
                installation of Apache 2 on Debian Linux was used.

            <p> <b> Loading Fedora Core 21 Linux on Serial Interface </b> <br>
                Using Cutecom and the serial interface cable, I was able to boot Fedora Core 21 Linux. <br>
                However, it would not start up in VGA mode, and I didn't have an HDMI monitor available. <br>
                Attempts to start Fedora 21 when the CubieTruck was connected to my TV in HDMI mode also proved <br>
                unsuccessful.  After a week of trying different things, I decided to wait for a VGA build of Fedora 21 <br>
                to come out, as I wanted to work on other current projects.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Many attempts at reflashing the NAND and MMC memory cards, and editing configuration files did not prove successful. <br>  
                Also, I have wiped away Android from the NAND flash memory in my attemp to get Fedora 21 to boot up in VGA mode. <br>  
                It is not a big deal       since I never wanted the CubieTruck to be an Android box in the first place.  
                Since it is too underpowered to act as a server for this webiste, I decided to make it my dedicated HAM radio computer. <br>  
                I have also installed an 80GB SATA 2.5" harddrive into the case and am currently running Cubian X as the OS.<br>
                Cubian X comes preset for VGA mode, and was no problem getting up and running.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Overall, it was an excellent learning experience trying to get Fedora 21 up and running. <br>
                I had to consult many books and websites to get things done, and the amount of things I learned about <br>
                my prefered Linux of choice (Red Hat Fedora Core) is invaluable.  I hope to one day earn a <br>
                Red Hat Ceritified Engineer (RHCE) certification: <br>

                I will now post details of my attempts at starting Fedora Core 21 on the CubieTruck in VGA mode.
