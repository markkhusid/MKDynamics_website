    <p> <b> Loading Fedora Core 21 Linux on Serial Interface </b> <br>
      Using Cutecom and the serial interface cable, I was able to boot Fedora Core 21 Linux. <br>
      However, it would not start up in VGA mode, and I didn't have an HDMI monitor available. <br>
      Attempts to start Fedora 21 when the CubieTruck was connected to my TV in HDMI mode also proved <br>
      unsuccessful.  After a week of trying different things, I decided to wait for a VGA build of Fedora 21 <br>
      to come out, as I wanted to work on other current projects.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      Many attempts at reflashing the NAND and MMC memory cards, and editing configuration files did not prove successful. <br>  
      Also, I have wiped away Android from the NAND flash memory in my attemp to get Fedora 21 to boot up in VGA mode. <br>  
      It is not a big deal       since I never wanted the CubieTruck to be an Android box in the first place.  
      Since it is too underpowered to act as a server for this webiste, I decided to make it my dedicated HAM radio computer. <br>  
      I have also installed an 80GB SATA 2.5" harddrive into the case and am currently running Cubian X as the OS.<br>
      Cubian X comes preset for VGA mode, and was no problem getting up and running.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Overall, it was an excellent learning experience trying to get Fedora 21 up and running. <br>
      I had to consult many books and websites to get things done, and the amount of things I learned about <br>
      my prefered Linux of choice (Red Hat Fedora Core) is invaluable.  I hope to one day earn a <br>
      Red Hat Ceritified Engineer (RHCE) certification: <br>

      This is the course that I want to take.  It is available as online training: <br>

      I will now post details of my attempts at starting Fedora Core 21 on the CubieTruck in VGA mode.
