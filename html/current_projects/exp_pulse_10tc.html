      Discretized Fourier Transform of Exponential Pulse Using SciLAB

    <h4>
      Discussion:
      <hr />
    </h4>
    <p>
      In this section, we will continue verification of the Fortran 2003 code by running it against a<br>
      an exponential pulse that has a time constant of 1/10 seconds.  We expect to see an exponential function for the<br>
      magnitude, and a characteristic phase plot as shown below.  As before, we will first generate a<br>
      DFFT in SciLAB to enable a meaningful comparison.<br>
      <hr /><br>
    </p>
    
    <p> <b> Introduction: </b><br>
      First, we start with SciLAB to generate a an exponential function, and multiply it by a 100% duty-cycle <br>
      square wave, of duration 1 seconds.  The resulting waveform is sampled at 1000Hz, and the data points are <br>
      saved into a CSV file.  We also perform a DFFT in SciLAB so that we may compare the results to the output<br>
      of our Fortran 2003 code that uses the FFTW3 algorithm.  The SciLAB code is shown below:<br>

    </p>
    
    <p> <b> Processing of CSV file into format suitable for input into Fortran 2003 DFFT code. </b> <br>
      Since the output of SciLAB is a comma separated value (CSV) file, a method is needed that will process<br>
      that file into another file, where the commas are removed and each data element is on a separate line.<br>
      Additionally, a the data elements need to be reformatted into fixed floating point, since the "e" <br>
      floating point format was noticed to possibly cause errors when input into the FFTW3 algorithm. <br>
      These operations were done using a Python script, with its powerful object-oriented file techniques and<br>
      its included CSV library.  The Python script is shown below: <br>

    <h4>
      Discussion:
      <hr />
    </h4>
    <p>
      There appears to be good correlation between the DFFT magnitude plot generated by SciLAB and <br>
      the DFFT magnitude plot generated by the Fortran 2003 code.  Of note are the anomalous<br>
      phase results in the output of the Fortran 2003 code.  It is unknown at this time what is causing it. <br>
