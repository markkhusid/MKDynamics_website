      Formation of a 50Hz Sine Wave using Python+Numpy

      Discussion:
      <hr />
    </h4>
    <p>
        We use Python together Numpy arrays to create a sine wave at 50Hz for 10 periods.  We then use the DFFT Fortran program to computer the DFFT and plot its output with GNUPlot.
      <hr /><br>
    </p>
    
    <p> <b> Introduction: </b><br>
      First, we start with a Python script to generate a 50Hz sine wave, sampled at 44100Hz, and save these raw data points to a file.  We also use Python's Wave package to produce a .wav file that can be actually played using wave file player software.<br>
      into a CSV file.  We also perform a DFFT in SciLAB so that we may compare the results to the output<br>
      of our Fortran 2003 code that uses the FFTW3 algorithm.  The SciLAB code is shown below:<br>

    <p> <b> Saving of time-domain data into a file </b> <br>
      The raw time-domain data is saved into a text file. <br>
      A portion of the data is shown below: <br>

    </p>
    
    <p> <b> Processing of CSV file into format suitable for input into Fortran 2003 DFFT code. </b> <br>
      Since the output of SciLAB is a comma separated value (CSV) file, a method is needed that will process<br>
      that file into another file, where the commas are removed and each data element is on a separate line.<br>
      Additionally, a the data elements need to be reformatted into fixed floating point, since the "e" <br>
      floating point format was noticed to possibly cause errors when input into the FFTW3 algorithm. <br>
      These operations were done using a Python script, with its powerful object-oriented file techniques and<br>
      its included CSV library.  The Python script is shown below: <br>

      The phase plot above displays overall quantization noise and computation noise of FFTW3, since <br>
      pure frequency sine wave with zero phase should have been a straight line at 0 degrees. <br>  
      This plot gives a feel for the accuracy of the computational engine. <br>

    <h4>
      Discussion:
      <hr />
    </h4>
    <p>
      There appears to be a slight skew in frequency in the peak of the DFFT plot.  It appears to show a peak of around 59Hz, rather than purely 50Hz.  Since other raw data inputs into the Fortran program produced results as expected, the skew may be related to the way the data were generated in Python+Numpy or the way it was saved into a text file.  More research is needed to find the cause.
